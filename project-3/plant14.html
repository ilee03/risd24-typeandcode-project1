                <p>Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are treasures of summertime. These low-maintenance plants typically begin blooming in the midsummer and can persist into early fall. The flowers, which stretch around three to six inches across on average, have a broad central disk surrounded by short, yellow petals. <br><br>These annuals are also available in other colors, like red, mahogany, cream, orange and bicolors. Sunflowers grow on a hairy, sturdy, upright stem that can reach up to 15 feet. Some varieties are fairly drought-tolerant.</p>

                <p>Light <br><br> For the best flowering and sturdiest stems, plant your sunflowers in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. Because they are heliotropic (their flower heads follow the sun), ample sun exposure will help sunflowers remain straight.

                        Here are the main care requirements to keep your Japanese flowering cherry tree growing healthy:<br><br>
                        <li>Sunflowers prefer a sunny location that gets at least six hours of sun per day and well-drained soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>They don't like to compete with weeds, so keep the garden clean.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mulching around your sunflowers will help maintain soil moisture and weed suppression.
                        </li>
                        <li>Wildlife is often attracted to sunflower seedlings, so it's best to protect seedlings with row covers or screening, removing the cover once the plants are about one foot tall.
                        </li>
