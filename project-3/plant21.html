                    Mint plants (Mentha spp.) <br>are very hardy perennials that can be grown indoors in containers or outdoors in the garden. These plants spread aggressively as their long stems grow upward, flop over, and root wherever they touch the soil. Mint plants produce small white or purple summer-blooming flowers that attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. Mint is a culinary delight and digestive aid known for its refreshing taste and its spicey scent also serves as a pest repellent. Mint is toxic to animals.

                <p>Light <br><br>
                    Mint plants prefer part shade, though too much shade produces leggy plants and less flavorful leaves. Mint will grow in full sun if watered frequently and somewhat protected from the strong afternoon sun.

                    Soil <br><br>
                    Mint adapts to most soil types but prefers rich and well-draining soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH.

                    <h2>How to care for <span>Mint</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>When to plant: <br> Plant mint outdoors in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. Generally, plant mint in late February to early March in zones 10 and above, in April in zones 5 to 7, and mid-May in zones 3 and 4.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mint Indoors <br> Choose a 12-inch container to give the plant room to grow. Use soil with low fertilizer formulated for edible plants. Place the plant where it will get four to six hours of daily sunlight and where the temperature stays between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep the soil moist and note that indoor mint plants may struggle in low humidity. Increase humidity by misting between waterings or using a water-filled tray of pebbles under the pot, especially during a dry winter.
                        </li>
                        <li>Temperature and Humitity <br> Water your mint during dry spells to keep the soil lightly moist, adding more water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Mint plants like water but waterlogged soil can rot their roots. Water mint in the morning so it stays moist as temperatures rise. Wilting foliage means the plant needs water.
                        </li>
