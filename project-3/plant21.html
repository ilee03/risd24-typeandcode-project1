                  The African iris (Dietes iridioides) is an evergreen plant that grows well in warmer zones, with a long season of flowering from spring through fall. It can be grown as a perennial in zones 8 to 11, and in colder zones is commonly grown as an annual. This plant thrives in full sunlight (but can bloom in partial shade) and is very drought-tolerant. Read on for our care and growing guide.

                <p>Light <br>
                  Thought it thrives best in full sunlight, the African iris will bloom in partial sunlight. In partial sunlight blooms may not be as vigorous. Ideally, it should get six hours of sun per day in its blooming season if possible, and afternoon sun is a bit stronger than morning sun for placement of this perennial.

                    <h2>How to care for <span>Irises</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil <br> These plants like a rich, well-drained loamy soil. Many irises are not fussy about soil, but the African iris requires good drainage to keep the rhizomes healthy. If you have clay soil, add some compost or other amendments to improve drainage before planting African iris.
                        </li>
                        <li>Water <br> Once established, the African iris is very drought tolerant and doesn't need any special watering. In times of extreme drought it might need to be watered. In its first two years, or right after planting, it should be watered regularly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Temperature and Humitity <br> Because they originate in a tropical climate, the African iris is not cold tolerant and will not survive as a perennial in places with harsh winter temperatures. Being very drought tolerant, they may not do too well in areas with high humidity in summer. Dividing them frequently allows air circulation to prevent any issues caused by too much dampness.
