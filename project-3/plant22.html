                <p>Chinese money plant (Pilea peperomioides), often called the friendship plant, coin plant, or UFO plant, is popular thanks to its attractive coin-shaped foliage and ease of care. It is grown primarily for its unique foliage and does not often flower indoors.
                <br><br>
                This perennial is a low-maintenance, air-purifying option that's also pet-safe. Chinese money plants are easy to propagate and share with friends, hence the name "friendship plant." With proper lighting, it can double in size within a year.
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br> Provide medium-to-bright, indirect light for your Chinese money plant. An east- or west-facing window may be ideal. Rotate your plant regularly to keep it looking symmetrical. Avoid locations that receive harsh, direct light as it will burn the delicate leaves.
                <br><br>
                While this plant can adapt to lower light conditions; it will become leggy, grow fewer offshoots, and the coin-shaped leaves may become smaller. Overall, this plant is the healthiest and most attractive when grown in bright light conditions.
