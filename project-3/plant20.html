                <p>Poinsettia <br>is a perennial shrub native to Mexico. It is most often grown as an annual for winter holiday display, but it can also be grown as a perennial garden shrub in regions where winter temperatures remain above 50°F. Also known as Mexican flameleaf, these plants are forced into bloom in time for the holiday season, and they require specific care to look their best into the new year and beyond.
                <br><br>
                The familiar red species has been joined by even flashier hues thanks to hybridizers who have expanded the range of colors from the familiar scarlet to white, cream, salmon, yellow, and pink. Its blooms are a cluster of tiny yellow flowers surrounded by large brilliant (usually red) floral bracts, which are modified leaves.

                <p>Light <br><br> Poinsettia do best when placed in bright, diffused sunlight, so place your plant near a sunny window where it will receive at least six to eight hours of diffused light per day. Be aware that exposure to direct sunlight can burn bracts and leaves.

                    <h2>How to Care for <span>Poinsettias</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        Keep your poinsettia healthy and vigorous beyond January by using the proper care techniques. The trick: Provide enough filtered sun, warmth, and water, and your poinsettia will thrive. If you're especially motivated and follow a regimen of specific care, your plant might rebloom next holiday season.

                        If grown as a landscape shrub in warm climates, poinsettia requires a sunny location and well-drained soil. Frequent pinching back of the stem tips will ensure seasonal color in winter.

                        <li>Poinsettias usually bloom in winter and spring, then go dormant, but with the right care, they can be coaxed into reblooming the following winter
                        </li>
                        <li>Plant in a well-draining potting soil
                        </li>
                        <li>Maintain temperatures between 65°F to 75°F
                        </li>
                        <li>Bright indirect or diffused light is best
                        </li>
                        <li>Located near a window where it will get indirect sunlight and away from cold drafts is ideal</li>
                        <li>Water when top surface of soil is dry; water less frequently during dormant stage of growth
                        </li>
                        <li>Contrary to a popular belief, poinsettias are not seriously toxic to people or pets. At most, they are mildly toxic to cats and dogs who ingest the plant material
