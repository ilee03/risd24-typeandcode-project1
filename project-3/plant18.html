                <p>The Easter lily is a bulb that's planted in the fall and emerges each spring, growing quickly. While the lily generally blooms in the summer, growers have cultivated varieties forced to bloom earlier to coincide with Easter. But don't expect to have flowers for the holiday from bulbs you planted in the fall, as, once in the ground, lilies may not bloom until their second year. This plant does best with full sun to partial shade and rich, well-draining soil. It's also important to note that indoor and outdoor Easter lily plants are toxic to cats.
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br> Easter lilies prefer to grow in full sun to partial shade, with protection from the strong afternoon sun during the heat of the day. Bright light tends to scorch the foliage. If possible, position your Easter lily so the top portion is in full sun, but the leaves and soil stay shaded, allowing the roots to remain cool. You can also plant shorter plants, or a groundcover, around a lily bed, or use a layer of mulch to keep the soil temperatures down.

                        <li>Plant bulbs in full sun to partial shade. Indoors, keep Easter lilies by a window with bright, indirect sunlight.

                        <li>Place them in rich, well-draining soil and keep them evenly moist.
