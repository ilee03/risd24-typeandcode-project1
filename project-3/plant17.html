                    Fuchsia is known for producing dozens of brightly colored dangling, teardrop-shaped flowers from trailing stems from spring through fall. They are a staple in hanging baskets and thrive in partial shade. Hummingbirds love fuchsia, which can be placed outside once night temperatures are consistently above 50 degrees.

                <p>Light <br>
                    These plants thrive in part shade to deep shade conditions. When growing indoors, they enjoy a bit more lightâ€”bright indirect light rather than direct sunlight.
                <br><br>Soil <br><br>
                Fuchsia plants prefer consistently moist (but not soggy) soil with a good ratio of organic matter. At the same time, the soil should be well-draining.
                <br><br>
                For in-ground plants, amending with peat moss or compost before planting is a good idea. Container plants do fine in an ordinary peat-based potting mix, provided the pot has good drainage.

                    <ul>
                        The Fuchsia genus contains more than 100 woody shrubs and trees, but the familiar garden fuchsia widely available in garden centers are mostly hybrids ideal for hanging baskets and other containers.
                        <br><br>
                        While these plants can be perennial garden plants in warm climates, fuchsias are usually grown as outdoor container plants, either planted as annuals and discarded as the weather turns cold or brought indoors and nursed in bright light and controlled conditions over the winter.
                        <br><br>
                        Though slightly fussy about moisture and temperature, fuchsias are still considered an easy plant to grow in container gardens. Most will thrive in part shade to full shade. They don't like to be too hot, and they especially hate dry heat.
