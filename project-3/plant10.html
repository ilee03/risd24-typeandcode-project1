                <p>Marigolds (Tagetes spp.) are among the most common and reliable of all bedding flowers. These cheerful flowers with warm colors and fern-like foliage are true annuals, completing their life cycles in a single growing season. The size and construction of the blooms can vary considerably, from tiny single-petal flowers of the signet marigolds to the large 4-inch double-petal blossoms of the African marigolds, but all show their membership in the aster family with flowers demonstrating the characteristic daisy-like appearance. Marigolds are typically planted from nursery starts or seeds planted in the spring after the soil can be worked. These fast-growing plants will achieve blooming maturity within a matter of a few months when planted from seeds. For earlier outdoor blooms, start the seeds indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost.

                <p>Light <br><br> For the most flowers and the healthiest plants, plant your marigolds in full sun. Shady conditions will cause the plants to become leggy and to flower less profusely.
                </p>

                <p>Soil <br><br>
                Marigolds are not fussy. Any good garden soil (and a little water during dry spells) should keep them happy, as long as the soil is not too acidic. Keep the soil pH roughly neutral, from 6.0 to 7.0 . They also don't need a soil that is particularly rich in organic matter and seem to grow better in a leaner soil.
                <br><br>
                Water <br><br>
                    When you first plant your marigold seeds or plants, make sure they get regular water. Don't leave them in dry soil for more than a couple of days.

                    <h2>How to Care <span>for Marigolds</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        Marigolds are very low-maintenance once established, and they are notably pest-free. In fact, they are sometimes planted as a deterrent to pests that attack other plants. Marigolds can bloom almost non-stop and will keep going all summer, until frost. To achieve that non-stop flowering, keep your marigolds deadheaded. Flowering may decrease slightly during the heat of summer but generally resumes in full force as cooler weather arrives.
                        <br>
                        Tall varieties of African marigold are sometimes planted by stripping off the lower leaves and burying the stems extra deep. This encourages an extra sturdy root system and minimizes the need for staking the plants.
