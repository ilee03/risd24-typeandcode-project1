                <p>Winterberry holly <br> is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States known for its dark green leaves and bright red berries that persist through the entire winter into spring. A slow-growing shrub with a rounded upright growth habit, winterberry typically grows 3 to 15 feet tall and readily suckers and spreads to form large thickets. Winterberry holly tolerates all types of conditions except extreme dryness and grows best in wetland areas. This shrub prefers full sunlight, puts up with poorly drained acidic soil, and thrives in just about any temperature. Winterberry holly is toxic to people and animals.12
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br> Winterberry holly thrives when it is planted in a location with full sun to partial shade. To ensure ample flowering and fruiting, plant the shrub where it receives at least six to eight hours of sunlight per day.
                <p>Soil <br><br> This plant adapts to both light and heavy soils but performs best in acidic loam (pH range 5.5 to 6.5) with a good level of organic material. It does poorly in neutral to alkaline soil, which can cause fatal chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves). Feeding it with a fertilizer designed for acid-loving plants can help modify soil pH levels if a soil test reveals soil that is neutral or too alkaline.

                    <h2>How to care for <span>Hollybery Plants</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        Here are the main care requirements for growing winterberry holly:<br><br>
                        <li>Buy a pair (male and female) of shrubs that bloom at the same time. Most quality garden centers include the gender on the plant tag so that you purchase the right pairs of plants.3
                        </li>
                        <li>Place the male variety within 40 to 50 feet of a female plant for pollination and berry production. These shrubs are dioecious (with specific genders).3
                        </li>
                        <li>Plant the shrubs in a spot with full sun for the best berry production.
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep soil moist and do not let the shrubs dry out. Poorly drained soil is acceptable for this shrub.
                        </li>
