                    Petunias <br> in flower beds and pots are among the most popular annual garden flowers. There are many petunia varieties to choose from; most of them are hybrids. You'll find these prolific bloomers with wide, trumpet-shaped flowers in almost every color but true blue. Colors range from solid to striped or veined, There are petunias with single or double blooms and with ruffled or smooth petals. The branching foliage is hairy and somewhat sticky. The growth habit is mounding or cascading. Some petunia varieties are more fragrant than others.

                    Most petunia varieties like full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. But in the heat of summer, partial shade (especially protection from the strong afternoon sun) will help to keep them refreshed and blooming better.
