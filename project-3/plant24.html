                <p>Azaleas are loosely branched, shade-loving evergreen or deciduous shrubs with elliptical leaves. They bring delightful white, purple, yellow, and red flowers—and all hues in between—to the spring garden when the clusters of funnel-shaped blooms appear. Azaleas need at least four hours of sunlight daily and afternoon shade in places with scorching summers. Keep their soil moist, acidic, and fertile for them to grow well.
                <br><br>
                Azaleas shrubs are best planted in the spring or early fall. Growth rates vary by species, but most are relatively slow-growing. A one-gallon container plant usually will flower in its first year but may take as much as 10 years to reach its full size. Azaleas are toxic to humans and animals.

                <p>Light <br><br> Azaleas flourish in a partial shade location in most regions with a few hours of the morning sun. so the flowers don't wilt if a spring day becomes too hot. Azaleas may respond well to full sun in colder climates, while gardeners in warmer climates should give their azaleas more shade.

                    <ul>
                        Here are the main care requirements for growing azaleas:<br><br>
                        <li>Grow in loose, well-draining, acidic soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>Take soil samples to ensure the soil has an acidic pH.
                        </li>
                        <li>Augment neutral or alkaline soils with peat moss to improve drainage and acidify the soil.</li>
                        <li>Plant in artificial berms or elevated planting areas with dense soil; it makes the soil more porous. </li>
                        <li>Keep soil moist but not soggy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ensure the plant has at least four hours of sunlight; locate it in a shadier spot in a high-heat climate.</li>
