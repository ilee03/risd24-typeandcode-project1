                    Arabian jasmine is famous for its fragrant flowers and its use in jasmine tea and leis (the Hawaiian name for it is pikake). It is a fast-growing evergreen climbing shrub. Glossy, dark green oval leaves create a beautiful contrast to the highly fragrant, white flowers that fade to pink as they age. These beautiful-smelling blooms appear all summer long and may continue to bloom year-round in warm climates. <br><br>

                    Arabian jasmine is either trained as a flowering vine with supports or maintained as a sprawling shrub. It also does very well in containers and makes an eye-catching plant for patios and porches.

                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br>
                    Full to partial sun is needed for healthy Arabian jasmine plants. At least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day is ideal. If kept indoors during the winter, be sure to place this plant in a very sunny window. 
                    <br><br>Soil <br><br>
                    Loose, loamy, humusy soil is preferred by this flowering shrub. It likes an evenly moist, well-draining soil medium. Adding compost will help loosen, enrich, and moisten the soil.
