                    Persimmon is native to the southeastern United States. Easily recognized in winter by its unusual rugged, blocky bark, it has thick, dark green leaves that turn a yellow fall color. Female trees produce large orange-brown fleshy fruit that are edible after the first frost. Native persimmon is not readily available in nurseries, but several selected cultivars are produced for their edible fruit.

                    Plant Jane magnolia in a location that has full sun or part shade. In cooler regions, opt for a full-sun site. The plant will benefit from partial shade in warmer regions. Avoid placing it in an area with warm southern exposure, which could encourage the buds to open too early in spring. If a magnolia gets too much hot sun, the blooms could suffer from sunscald.

                        Persimmons do best in full sun and moderate to well-drained fertile soil, but they are tolerant of a wide range of soil moisture and pH levels. They will tolerate dry and swampy areas. May be difficult to transplant due to a deep taproot. Persimmon can sucker from the roots, increasing the maintenance of this tree. This species has separate male and female trees. Female trees produce edible fruit which can be messy.
