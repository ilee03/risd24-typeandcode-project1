                    Orange trees are one of the most recognized types of citrus trees featuring full, leafy canopies and fragrant flower displays followed by their famous fruit. A full-size orange tree can grow to 32 feet tall, with dwarf varieties reaching about 12 feet in height. Orange trees are planted in the ground after the possibility of frost has passed but dwarf trees can be planted any time in containers, which makes them great for indoor gardening, as well. Although the fruit is delicious, the plant itself is known to be toxic to pets.

                <p>Light <br><br>
                    Orange trees require plenty of sunlight to produce the best-tasting fruits, so choose a spot that receives full sun for eight to 10 hours a day. For dwarf varieties grown indoors, place them in a sunny window.

                    <h2>How to care for <span>Orange Trees</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>When to Plant <br>Orange trees can be planted at any time of year in warm climates, like southern Florida where they represent a major food crop. For cooler climates with significant seasonal variations, orange trees grow better when planted in spring or summer which allows them to acclimate before cooler weather arrives. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Soil <br>Orange trees thrive in loamy, rich, well-draining soil. Excess water must drain away, as orange trees cannot tolerate heavy, wet soil. When planting these trees, you can mix in potting soil for additional nutrients. Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH levels from 6.0 to 7.0 work best.
                        </li>
                        <li>Water <br> Orange trees need consistent watering but don't tolerate soggy soil. Drainage can be improved by building up a small mound at the bottom of the planting hole.2 Established orange trees do best with about 1 inch of water a week. How often you water will depend on the amount of rainfall you receive. Yellowing leaves on an orange tree may indicate root rot from overwatering.
