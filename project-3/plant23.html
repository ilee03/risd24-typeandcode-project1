                    Sweet woodruff, <br><br> also called sweetscented bedstraw, is a creeping, mat-forming perennial with dainty flowers that is commonly used as a groundcover in shady areas, only needing a little bit of sunlight each day. Sweet woodruff also performs well in mild temperatures and a variety of soil types, though it prefers acidic soil.
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br>
                    Sweet woodruff grows well in full shade to partial shade, particularly when it is planted under trees. Full sun, especially when it's at its brightest in the middle of summer, can scorch the leaves.

                    <h2>How to care for <span>Sweet Woodruff</span>:</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        Sweet woodruff quickly spreads by creeping rhizomes and self-seeding and can end up becoming too aggressive in some gardens, if the conditions are ideal. Here are the main care requirements for sweet woodruff:
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Avoid planting in full sun, and consider planting under a tree; sweet woodruff prefers shade or partial sunlight.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prepare well-draining soil, ideally on the acidic side.
                        </li>
                        <li>Only water in periods of drought; otherwise, sweet woodruff will be fine on its own.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fertilizer isn't needed once sweet woodruff is established.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
