                <p>Ipomoea nil<br> is a species of Ipomoea morning glory known by several common names, including picotee morning glory, ivy morning glory, ivy-leaf morning glory, and Japanese morning glory. It is native to the tropical Americas, and has been introduced widely across the world.
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br> Planting your morning glory in a spot that gets full sun is especially important. The flowers will only open when they are in direct sunlight, so daily exposure to full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours a day) will give you the longest amount of bloom time.
                <br>
                <br>If they are in a spot that doesn't get sun until the afternoon, don't expect "morning" glories.
