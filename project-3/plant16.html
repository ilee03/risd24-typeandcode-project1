                <p>Hardy geraniums <br> are flowering perennials comprised of many cultivars, species, and hybrids within the Geranium genus, collectively called cranesbill geraniums. These are commonly-grown, low-growing, dense, carpet-like plants, not to be confused with zonal geraniums.
                <br><br>
                These perennials have flower stalks that poke and weave through neighboring plants, floating on top of the plant. The small white, blue, pink, magenta, purple, lavender, and blue flowers are one inch wide and cupped-shaped, attracting butterflies and bees.
                <br><br>
                Hardy geraniums grow best in well-drained, moderately rich soil. Most will do well in either full sun or partial shade, but they like to be fairly dry—they can become prone to mildew if kept damp. Note that geraniums are toxic to pets.1
                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br> Hardy geraniums accept a wide range of exposure conditions. For the best flowering and vigorous geranium plants, site them in full sun to partial shade.
                <br><br>
                If geraniums are grown in hot, full sun, provide regular water. Some varieties of geraniums can tolerate full shade, but they likely won't blossom as fully as those with plenty of sun.

                    <ul>
                        Here are the main care requirements for growing a hardy geranium:
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Site them in a spot with full or partial sun; more sun equals more blooms.
                        </li>
                        <li>Give regular water, especially if in a full-sun location.
                        </li>
                        <li>Plant hardy geraniums so that the crown is at ground level or slightly above.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prune them after flowering to prompt repeated blooming into the fall.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prefers neutral to slightly acidic soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>Give well-balanced, time-released fertilizer if the soil is poor.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
