                 The charm of snapdragons in a garden is strong but fleeting because they are cool-weather annuals that quickly fade when summer turns up the heat. However, angelonia (Angelonia angustifolia) is a lookalike that is ready to stand strong long after the last snapdragon has wilted. Grown as an annual in cooler climates, angelonia is a perennial in USDA cold hardiness zone 9 and higher. This plant requires full sun and moist, well-draining soil. Read on for our care guide.

                </p>

                <p>Light <br><br>
                    Plant angelonia in full sun to provide the energy it needs to bloom continuously. Plants that don't receive at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight will grow tall and leggy with fewer blooms.
                    <br><br>Soil <br><br>
                    Angelonia tolerates a wide variety of soils but prefers a soil pH of 5.5 to 6.2. Soil rich in organic matter will reduce watering and fertilizing chores. Plants need good drainage to prevent root rot. If the garden soil is heavy clay, consider amending the soil to improve its tilth or grow angelonia in a raised bed or container.
                <br><br>Water <br><br>
                    Water young plants regularly to keep the soil evenly moist. Established angelonia will keep blooming through short periods of drought. Water when the top few inches of soil feel dry. Mulch around the plant to preserve soil moisture.

                        The easiest way to plant angelonia is to purchase bedding plants, which you'll find at nurseries and garden centers in the spring. Wait two or three weeks after the last frost because the plants need warm temperatures and lots of sun to prosper.
                        <br><br>
                        Plant angelonia in the center of any garden bed with rich soil and full sun exposure. With a maximum height of 2 feet, its spires won't tower over other plants. Space plants 12 to 18 inches apart. Angelonia also makes an excellent thriller in a container with other plants that also thrive in full sun and moist soil.

                        <li>Plant it in a location with full sun and well-draining soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>Water plants until established and in extended dry periods.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fertilize lightly at the beginning of the season.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pinch young plants to encourage bushier growth.
